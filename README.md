# Sports Science goes Open Source: A repositorium for educational resources
In this project we are going to create resources, that will help you to understand and code common analyses in the sport sciences. We will cover a broad range from simple to advanced topics. You are welcome to contribute!
## Current state

## Guide for newbies
We would advise you to start learning some basic python.
It is not necessary but it gives you a deeper understanding in the language, therefore the modules you'll be using are much easier to understand.
After learning the basics, the next step is to look up the modules:
- Numpy           (important for math)
- Matplotlib      (Helpfull for visualizing the Data)
- Pandas          (Used for reading out the .csv Data)

### Resources to start with
We have gathered some Recourcess to to learn with.
For the basics:
Websites
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course
- https://www.learnpython.org/
Videos
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI
GitHub:
- https://github.com/anvinh01/LearningPython 

If you want to skip the basics and move on to Data Analyisis, here is a usefull video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-uOLxNrNk8

For Module documentation:
- https://numpy.org/
- https://matplotlib.org/
- https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/


### Starting your own project
## Guide for contributors
As Contributor you should first install git from: https://git-scm.com/
For all important commands: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html

- After the first install. You have to open "Git Bash" and give in your github username and email: 'git config --global user.name "Sam Smith"' and 'git config --global user.email sam@example.com'

- Create a directory for our Project.
- press Right Click and open "Git Bash"
- create a connection to our GitHub: "git remote add origin https://github.com/RobShaver21/SportsDataScience.git"
- Pull our project from the github with: "git pull https://github.com/RobShaver21/SportsDataScience.git"
- You can now make changes.
- After you are done type into the git bash: "git add ."
- Then commit: 'git commit -m "text of your changes" '
- At last push in the changes: "git push origin main"

You have succesfully comitted into our GitHub.
