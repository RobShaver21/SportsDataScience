# Sport Science goes Open Source: A repositorium for educational resources
In this project we are going to create resources, that will help you to understand and code common analyses in the sport sciences. We will cover a broad range from simple to advanced topics. You are welcome to contribute!

## Topics

### Athlete Montitoring 
-	Monitoring Dashboards
... Individualized Speed Thresholds
...	Metabolic Power / Energy Level
... Internal / External Ratio
... Individualized TRIMP coefficients
-	Framework for downloading, processing, reporting
-	API download
-	Data processing
- User Interface

### Deutscher Motorik Test (DMT)
-	Data Processing (Input: test data, reference data)
-	Dashboards (individual and group-based)

### Lactate thresholds
- Different threshold models
-	Dashboard (individual and group-based)

### Basic Analyses
-	Counter movement jump (CMJ)
-	CMJ + Rebound jump 
-	Centre of pressure (COP)
-	CMJ + COP
-	Electromyography 
-	input from several devices

### Gait analysis (Chambers, Sutherland (2002))
-	Data processing (angles)
-	Gait cycles (duration, normalization)
-	Data visualization

### Data Merging
-	Data processing (sensor data (IMU), mobile data, questionnares)
... Energy modelling
-	Data Merging
... Example: Data Merger (Mobisens)
... data aggregation
... event analysis
- Research
... activity ~ well-beeing
... Electrodermal activity (EDA) ~ stress
... EDA ~ activity
... EMG ~ psychosocial parameters
... activity ~ HR(V)

### Real-Time Feedback
-	Data Processing / Analysis for feedback on health-promoting behaviour
... Next-Level Project ...

### Modulartige Software der durchgef√ºhrten Analysen (vgl Jamovi)
- Integrative point & click surface of the analysis above (e.g. Lactate thresholds, gait analysis)

### Video panel for online sports courses
- many video panel: individualized group exercise

### Health-Navigation portal
- Meta-Database of all health-related activities: prevention/rehabilitation courses, recreational sports, dietary consultance, etc.
... Merge existing data
... Merge user-generated data
... Data Mining: anamnesis, evidence - treatment tailorment based on prediction models
